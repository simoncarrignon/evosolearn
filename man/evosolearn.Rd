\arguments{
\item{pop}{the current population upon wihch statistics have to be calculated}

\item{statfun}{a vector with the different function we apply on the population}

\item{statvar}{a vector with the different varaible we measure in the population}

\item{prop}{if the proporition of different strategies should be ouptut}

\item{ouptut}{a current output to be update or initialized if NULL}

\item{ouptut}{a current output to be update or initialized if NULL}

\item{pop}{if NULL, initialised using n  and uniform gene distribution, else should be a matrix as done by generatePop}

\item{statvar}{a vector with the different variable to track in the population}

\item{statfun}{a vector with the different function to apply tracked variable}

\item{prop}{if the proporition of different strategies should be ouptuted}
